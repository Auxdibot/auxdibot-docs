You can add Auxdibot to your server using [this link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1099157101978329138&scope=bot&permissions=8).

:::

Thank you for choosing Auxdibot!

You can auto*magically* configure Auxdibot for your server by running the command `/setup auto`, which will create a default set of channels (Including Starboard, Logging, and Suggestions), roles, automod settings.

Auxdibot's features are organized into individual "Modules" containing functionality and commands. You can run the command `/help all` to view a Module's brief description, and its commands.

## Navigating Auxdibot

-------------

### Dashboard

:::info
For more information on the Dashboard, view the [Dashboard](/navigating/dashboard) section.
:::

Auxdibot features a dashboard with an intuitive and easy-to-approach UI. You can sign into Auxdibot's website by opening the `Sign in` menu in the navigation menu, and clicking `Sign in`.

You will be redirected to Discord to authenticate your Discord account. Once you have been authenticated through Discord, you can open up the Account menu by clicking your username in the navigation menu. In the Account menu, you can click `Servers` to view a list of the servers you can edit using Auxdibot.

Once you have added Auxdibot to your server, you can click the `Dashboard` button next to your server's icon to open Auxdibot's Dashboard. From there, you can select a category and edit Auxdibot's settings.

### Command Syntax

You can view command usage in `/help all` or by viewing a command using `/help command`.

| Syntax  | Syntax Description |
| ------------- | ------------------- |
| `(argument)`| Argument is required. |
| `[argument]` | Argument is not required. |
| `(argument\|argument2)`| One of two arguments are required. |

Commands contain subcommand groups or subcommands. (ex. `/command group subcommand` or `/command subcommand`)

### Placeholders

Placeholders can be used in Embeds and more. You can view a list of all placeholders by running the command /help placeholders. Placeholders are *cAsE iNsEnSiTivE*, and can be wrapped with `% %` (percent symbols) or `{% %}` (curly bracket followed by percent symbols) (`%placeholder%` and `{%PLACEHOLDER%}` will both work the same)

## Basic Setup

-------------


### Enabling/Disabling Modules

If you do not like one of Auxdibot's modules or are experiencing compatability issues with another bot, you can disable the module by using the `/modules disable` or `/modules enable` command. When a module is disabled, its commands cannot be run and any functionality relating to that module is disabled.

### Commands

You can create command rules using the `/commands` command. Command Rules specify requirements for an Auxdibot command, such as requiring a command to be run in a specific channel, or requiring a certain role to run a command. Users with the `Administrator` Discord permission on your server will bypass any command rules.
* `/commands admin set (command) (admin_only)` - Specify whether a command can only be used by Discord Administrators.
* `/commands usage channel [channel]` - Restrict all Auxdibot commands to a specific channel.
* `/commands usage (disable|enable) (command)` - Enable or disable an Auxdibot command.

### Logging & Moderation

Logging and Moderation can be automatically configured using the `/setup moderation` command, which will allow Administrators to setup:

* A Moderator role that can punish users.
* A mute role that is given to a user who is muted.
* A log channel.
* A warn threshold before a user receives a mute.
* A reporting system and channel.

Auxdibot allows you to log actions that are performed on your server! Additionally, any errors that may occur with schedules, notifications, and more will be logged to your log channel.
* `/logs channel [channel]` - Set the log channel for this server. 
* `/logs actions` - List every Auxdibot log action.
* `/logs filter (action)` - Toggle an Auxdibot log action. When a log action is disabled, it will not be logged to your log channel.
* `/logs latest` - View the latest logs on your server.

By default, Auxdibot utilizes Discord's Timeout system. If administrators wish to issue permanent mutes, a mute role will need to be specified using the `/moderation settings mute_role [role]` command. You can revert to using Discord's timeout system by running the command without specifying a `role`.

### Starboard

Starboards can be automatically created using the `/setup starboard` command, which will allow Administrators to setup:

* A starboard, with a channel, reaction, and reaction count.

Up to 2 starboards can be added to a server. When a message receives enough reactions, it will be posted to the starboard for that server.

Starboards can be modified with the `/starboard board` commands.

### Reaction Roles

Auxdibot's reaction roles come in various shapes and sizes. You can create a reaction role (with an automatically created embed) by using `/reaction_roles add (channel) (roles) [title] [type]`.

When creating a reaction role, for the `roles` parameter, you need to specify an emoji, followed by a space, followed by the role to receive when reacting with that emoji.

**Example**: `/reaction_roles add channel:#my-channel title:My Reaction Role roles:ðŸ˜€ @Role1 ðŸ¤– @Role2`

You can specify a reaction role `type` to decide how users interact with your reaction role.

| Type | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `Default` | The default method for reaction roles. The users reaction is removed and they will receive/lose the role. |
| `Select One`   |  The default method for reaction roles, except the user can only have one of the roles specified. |
| `Sticky` | The users reaction is not removed, and they will receive/lose the role. |
| `Sticky (Select One)` | The users reaction is not removed, except the user can only have one of the roles specified. |
| `Discord Button` | Utilize Discord Buttons instead of reactions on the Discord Embed. |
| `Discord Button (Select One)` | Utilize Discord Buttons instead of reactions on the Discord Embed, except the user can only have one of the roles specified. |
| `Select Menu` | Utilize Discord Select Menus instead of reactions on the Discord Embed, allowing users to select multiple roles at one time. |
| `Select Menu (Select One)` | Utilize Discord Select Menus instead of reactions on the Discord Embed, except the user can only have one of the roles specified. |

You can utilize `/reaction_roles add (channel) (roles) [type] [...embed parameters]` to create an embed. See [Embeds](/modules/embeds) for more information on Embed Parameters.

### Suggestions

Suggestions can be enabled and automatically configured using the `/setup suggestions` command, which will allow Administrators to setup:

* A suggestions channel
* A suggestions update channel
* A suggestions moderator role
* A set of suggestions reactions
* Discussion threads for suggestions.

Users can create suggestions with the `/suggest (suggestion)` command, and their suggestion will be output to the suggestions channel. Administrators or people with permission can mark a suggestion accepted/denied/considered/added by running the command `/suggestions respond (id) (response, considered/added/denied/accepted) [reason]`.

* You can enable/disable discussion threads by running the command `/suggestions discussion_threads (create_thread)`
* You can ban a user from suggestions by running the command `/suggestions ban (user)`

### Levels

Levels are by default disabled. Levels can be enabled and automatically configured using the `/setup levels` command, which will allow Administrators to setup:

* A message XP system
* A voice chat XP system
* A starboard message XP system
* An event join XP system
* A levelup channel where all levels are posted.

You can disable Levels by running the command `/modules disable Levels`

* You can modify the levelup message by running the command `/levels message set [...embed parameters]`
* You can add multipliers to your server by running the `/levels multipliers` commands.
* You can add level rewards to your server by running the `/levels rewards` commands.

### Join/Leave Messages

Levels can be enabled and automatically configured using the `/setup greetings` command, which will allow Administrators to setup:

* A greetings channel to greet users when they join the server.

Greetings come with default embeds for when a user joins/leaves the server. You can set the channel where greeting/leaving messages are sent using `/greetings channel [channel]`. When a greetings channel is not set, no Join/Leave messages are sent.

Join DM greetings are sent directly to the user when they join the server, if their privacy settings allow it.

:::info
See [Embeds](/modules/embeds) for more information on Embed Parameters.
:::

You can modify the Join/Leave/Join DM messages at any time by running the `/(join|leave|join_dm) message [...embed parameters]` commands.  Additionally, you can preview the Join/Leave/Join DM messages by running the commands `/(join|leave|join_dm) preview`

### Join Roles

Join Roles allow a user to receive roles when they join your server! Administrators or members with permission can add a Join Role by running the command `/join_roles add (role)`.

### Sticky Roles

Sticky Roles (or "Rejoin" Roles) are roles that are "stuck" to the user when they leave the server. If the user leaves the server and rejoins, the roles that they had that were added as Sticky Roles are given back to the user.

Administrators or members with permission can add a Sticky Role by running the command `/sticky_roles add (role)`.
